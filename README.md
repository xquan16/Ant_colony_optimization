# AI Research: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for TSP

This repository contains the work focusing on hyperparameter tuning for the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm.

## Research Paper (JATI Submission)

Our primary contribution is the academic paper formatted for submission to the JATI (Journal of Applied Technology and Innovation):

**"Tuning hyperparameters on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm's performance for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)."**


## Purpose of this Fork

This repository is a **fork** of the original `Ant_colony_optimization` codebase by Saroj Poudel. The original Python implementation was used as the foundation for our experiments.

Our work involved:
1.  **Implementing** the base algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
2.  **Conducting experiments** to analyze how different hyperparameters (like alpha, beta, evaporation rate, etc.) impact the algorithm's performance.
3.  **Analyzing** the convergence speed and solution quality based on these tuned parameters.
4.  **Authoring** the research paper based on our findings.
